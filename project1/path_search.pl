%% =============== CS314 Prolog Project (Owner: Yanhao Chen) ================== %%
% Introduction:
% 	Train schedules can get very complex. Many countries with extenstive mass transit can 
%		have dizzying schedules with different service on weekends, expresses, specials, 
%		holiday trains, shuttles and any number of other variations. Monty Python's Flying Circus
%		based at least one sketch on the arcane and ever-changing English train system's schedule
%		where discovery of feasible solutions for generating a rail route solved a murder mystery:
%		    https://montypython.net/scripts/railway.php
%		.. too bad they weren't computer scientists.
%
%		One of the main powers of Prolog is that you do not need to understand the whole if you
%		understand the parts and how they relate. You can enumerate the qualities things have as facts, 
%		code how they relate as rules, thenyou can use that knowledge base to find solutions to very
%		complicated queries involving many rules with any number of requirements.
%		
%		In this project, you are going to find the path between two stations on a certain day with
% 	the train schedule info given below. You need to generate a weighted where each
%		note represents a station and each edges represents a path between the stations it joins.
%		Once you have the train station problem represented as a graph you can bring all your
%		graph searching algorithms to bear. There are three very useful algorithms for searching
%		graphs to find a minimal path; depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
%
%		The search algorithm will return a path with a cost that represents the length of the 
% 	path. Different search algorithms may return different paths with different costs 
% 	while the Dijkstra algorithm is guaranteed to return the path with the smallest cost.
% 
%What to implement:
%		Implementing all of Dijkstra's, BFS and DFS may be a bit difficult, so the TAs have
%		kindly implemented that for you (w00t)! All you have to do is build a library of smaller
%		helper rules that their code relies on.
%
%		The first segment below is a test library with some basic rules and routes. Feel free
%		to test yoru code them. Examples for the rules below are written presuming this test data.
%
%		The second segment below is a utility library. You do not have to implement any
%		of the rules in the utility library, however we strongly recommend you do.
%		You will find them very useful later and they serve as good practice to get started.
%
%		The third and forth segments below are the graph and helper libraries. 
%		You must implement all of the rules in both of them, except for the navigate rule.
%		The TAs also implemented that for you. You can use it to check your implementation
%		by giving it queries like:
%			navigate(sun, s1, s9, bfs, P, C).
%			navigate(mon, s9, s1, dfs, P, C).
%			navigate(tue, s2, s5, dijkstra, P, C).
%		The graph search algorithms are	implemented such that they rely on the rules in the
%		graph and helper libraries.
%
%		The last segment holds the TAs' implementations of the various graph search
%		algorithms. Do not modify them. You may however find looking over them useful
%		in order to see how the helper rules are used.
%
%Methodology and guidelines:
%		Holy moly! This might seem like a lot. Take it one bit at a time. You don't need to
%		understand the whole to make the parts work.
%
%		Take a look at the example data and the image links that depict the graphs directly
%		to get a feel for how the data is being represented. It may be very useful to spend
%		some time first completing the rules in the utility library. They can make coding up the
%		rules in the helper library much more simple and they will get you used to working with
%		the data.
%
%		Many of the rules in the utility library are fairly simple. They shouldn't present too
%		much of a challenge given the recent homework.
%
%		The graph rules are also astoundingly simple. They only represent interpreting the facts
%		and rules in the test section as a graph. No more, no less.
%
%		While the rules in the helper library may look very complex, most of what you need to
%		do is structural. Put the minimum of X in Y, make a list of Xs where Y, or change X if Y
%		are the essential themes. It can help to approach each rule as an individual element
%		and to only think about what is necessary to implement it given the rules you have so far.
%		The examples can be very useful in determining what has to change where for a rule to
%		work correctly.
